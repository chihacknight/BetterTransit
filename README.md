#Mapping Chicago’s Transportation Network Efficiency
Objectives:

•	Map multi-modal usage density of Chicago’s streets (bus, cars, small-vehicle (scooter/motorcycle)).

  o	A usable, interactive data map that can (or be reformatted to) answer such questions as:
  
    -What streets are used the most?
  
    -Where can the city remove the traditional grid system in favor of a more organic approach
  
    -Are there benefits to upgrading/changing transport networks?
  
    -What are the industrial roads? Can they be consolidated?

•	Identify outlier streets

  o	Most used

    -Implications: Requires pre-emptive maintenance… More?

  o	Least used

    -Implications: Opportunity to recycle for more pedestrian/public purposes

  o	Most costly

    -Implications: ?

  o	Opportunities for socializing transit costs

    -Transit network upgrades if City can afford it

• Scenario analysis(?)

  o	Is there a market for bike trail here?

  o	Would anybody notice if N Seeley Ave was turned into a Green Alley?

  o	Why the Green Alley along east of S Prairie Ave should have some commercial zones.

  o	Why BRT downtown is a band-aid, what's more permanent and more pedestrian friendly?
