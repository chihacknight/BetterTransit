Mapping the Demand for Better Transit
We’re mapping the density of people sitting on buses throughout the city in order to show where there’s enough ridership to warrant upgrading from buses stuck in traffic to something better—like a bus lane, BRT, or light rail. What other factors do we need to consider in determining if a dedicated transit lane is warranted?
